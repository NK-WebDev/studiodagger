### Project Overview

Cashpay is a digital wallet for instant, secure and hassle-free online payments in Nepal. You can recharge your mobiles, pay bills, book tickets wherever you are and whenever you want in Nepal. I had the task of creating a landing page for this app. The main objectives of this landing page were as follows:

- Showcase all the key features of Cashpay
- Provide an easy way for visitors to signup or download the app
- Demonstrate how Cashpay works

### The Process

As the lead designer and developer of the site, I had to figure out how to fulfil these objectives while creating an insightful and engaging landing page for this app. For any landing page, the most important thing is that it has to be effective and it has to communicate it's ideas to the site visitors in a clear but engaging way. Therefore I used the following tactics to make sure this landing page would get the job done:

- A minimalist design with a limited colour palette to avoid distractions
- Simple, Straightforward and engaging copywriting
- Iconography with clear labels
- Simple Navigation and a couple of Call to action buttons placed in key places
- Use of actual screenshots of the app along with an engaging parallax scrolling effect to demonstrate the use of the app and it's key features

### The Result

After the design and deployment of the site, the results were clear and easy to understand thanks to google analytics and user data. The following positive trends were seen after the launch of the site:

- 35% user growth
- More than 5000 new users registered with the site in the first month alone
