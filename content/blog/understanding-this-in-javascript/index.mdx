**this** is one of the features in JS that has lead to a lot of confusion among developers but as it turns out with just 4 golden rules you can easily figure out what **this** refers to in a JavaScript function.

The main source of confusion regarding this is that it works a little differently to other languages. The most important thing to remember when working with **this** in JavaScript is that -

_this is not author time binding but run time binding so it's not about where a function is declared but how it's called_

In JS there are 4 different types of this bindings and they have their own order of precidence. So without further ado I present to you the 4 different this bindings in ascending order of precedence.

1. Default binding:
   If any of the other bindings are not applied then this is the default binding of **this**. Most of the function calls in your code probably have default binding. The value of this is bound by default to the global object (the window object when working with JS in the browser). Default binding happens when you call a function with just the function name and it's arguments within bracets and no other decorators.

   _Note: If the function is in strict mode then by default **this** refers to undefined_

   `function foo(){ this.a = 4; // creates a global variable a and is equivalent to var a = 4; in the global scope or window.a = 4; } foo(); console.log(a) // 4 function bar(){ strict; this.a = 6; // since this is undefined in strict mode a cannot be set of undefined and results in an error console.log(a); } bar() // type Error`

2. Implicit Binding:
   This type of binding happens when the function is called as a method on an object. The value of **this** is the object itself.

   `obj: { a:4, foo: function(){ console.log(this.a); } } obj.foo(); // 4`

   _Note it does not matter where the function is declared, just as long as it is called as a method of the object_

   `
   function foo(){
   console.log(this.a);
   }

   obj: {
   a:7,
   foo: foo
   }

   obj.foo() // 7
   `
   _Note: Only the top/last level of an object property reference chain matters._

   `function foo(){ console.log(this.a); } obj1{ a: 4, foo: foo } obj2{ a: 7, obj1: obj1 } obj2.obj1.foo() // 4`

   _Note: Implicitly bound functions can loose thier binding when assigned to other variables and called by that variable_

   `

   foo(){
   console.log(this.a);
   }

   obj = {
   a: 7,
   foo: foo
   }

   var bar = obj.foo() // this is just a reference to the actual function it does not care about the implicit binding

   var a = 11;

   bar(); // 11 // this defaults to the global object

   `

3. Explicit Binding:
   Most of the build in functions and all user defined functions have two special utility methods called apply and call which can be use to invoke the functions. Explicit binding happens when you use those two special methods. The value of this is really easy to figure out because it is expicitly passed in as the first argument to the call or apply methods.

   `
   function foo(b){
   console.log(this.a);
   }

   obj = {
   a: 4
   }

   let bar = foo.call(obj); // this returns the foo function where this is bound to the obj object

   bar(); // 4

   `
   _Note: apply and call both work the same for explicitly binding this to the given value but the way they pass in other arguments is a little different. You can read about them [here](https://mdn.com)_

   _Note: you may have used the .bind es6 method before which uses explicit binding under the hood_

4. new binding:

   To understand this type of binding you have to first understand how constructors work in JavaScript. In JS constructors are just functions that happen to be called with the new operator in front of them. They are not attached to classes nor are they instantiating a class. They are just regular functions hijacked by the use of new in thier invocation.

   Any user defined or built in function can be called with a new in front of it and that makes it a construction call.There is no such thing as constructor functions but rather construction calls of functions.

   Following things are done when a constructor call is made

   - A brand new object is created
   - the new object is prototype linked (this is not important for the current topic)
   - the object is set as the this binding for the function call
   - unless the function returns it's own alternate object , the new invoked function call will return the newly constructed object.

   `function foo(){ this.a = 4; } var bar = new foo() // bar is set to the newly created object; console.log(bar.a) // 4`

   5. Arrow Functions:
      I know I promised there were only 4 different types of **this** binding and traditionally that was true until es6 when arrow functions were introduced.

      `// arrow functions use the fat arrow => instead of the function keyword. (a) => { console.log(a); }`

      Arrow functions are not just a quicker way to write functions but they do **this** binding a little different. They use lexical scope for **this**. If you wanna read more about lexical scope I have a [post about that too](linktomypost.com). But all you need to know about the **this** in arrow functions is that they inherit the value of **this** from thier inclosing function and I mean the function where the arrow functions are declared inside and not where they are actually called.

      `function foo(){ return () => { console.log(this.a) // here this actually refers to the this of the foo function } } var obj1 = { a: 4 } var obj2 = { a: 7 } var bar = foo.call(obj1); // sets this binding to obj1 var baz = bar(); gets the arrow function as the return value var myFunc = baz.call(obj2); // tries to set the this binding of the arrow function to obj2 myFunc(); // 4 the arrow function's this is set to the this of foo which was bound to obj1`
      Therefore the **this** binding of arrow function is actually done in author time rather than run time like the other types of **this** binding.

      `//pre es6 way of achieving the arrow function binding function foo(){ var self = this; function bar (){ console.log(self); } }`

   Here is a helpful flowchart for you to remember the **this** binding in JavaScript and remember if you're dealing with an arrow function then figure out the **this** binding of the enclosing function and that's you're answer.
