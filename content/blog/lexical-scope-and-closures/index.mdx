### Do I really need to understand these things?

Can't I just memorize some stuff about scopes and closures for job interviews, Will I really need them? Nope and Yes. Read till the end and it may surprise you how much JavaScript uses closures.

### How Scopes works in JavaScript

_Scope consists of a series of bubbles that each act as a container or bucket in which identifiers are declared , these bubbles nest inside each other and this nesting is defined at author time._ - Kyle Simpson

Scope is just the set of rules that govern how the JavaScript engine can look up a variable and figure out it's value. JavaScript had only function scope (with a few exceptions) until es6 which meant that whenever a new function was declared a new scope was created.

`//global scope`
`var i = 666`
`console.log(i) // 666`

`function foo(){ var i = 777; console.log(i) }`

`foo(); // scope of foo`

// note: you might have heard the term lexical scope which is the scope that is defined during a step in the compilation process called lexing. It basically means the scope that is defined when you are writing the code i.e declaring functions.

### Scopes in ES6

ES6 introduced two different ways to declare variables using let and const which can used to for block scoping. In other words, now whenever you use let or const to declare variables they are scoped to the block (any code surrounded by a pair of curly brackets).

`//global scope`
`var i = 666`
`console.log(i) // 666`

`if(true){ let i = 777; console.log(i) // 777 }`

### Scopes are nested

Another important thing you need to know before we dive into closures is that scopes are nested. The inner scope has access to the outer enclosing scope but the outer scope can't access the inner scope.

`function foo(){ let i = 777; console.log(i) // 777 console.log(b) // Refference Error function barr(){ console.log(i) // 777 console.log(c) // Refference Error let b = "hello"; { console.log(b) // hello let c = "bye"; } } }`

### What are closures

_Closure is when a function can remember and access it's scope even when it's called outside it's scope_

`function foo(){ let a = 666; function bar(){ console.log(a); // 666 } bar(); } foo();`
This is a pretty simple function which just showcases the nesting of scope. when bar is called it has access to the variable 'a' so it can successfully console the value. Now, take a look at the next example which does the same thing but uses closure.

`function foo() {
let a =666;
function bar(){
console.log(a);
}
return bar;
}
let myFunc = foo() // now myFunc has the reference to the bar function inside foo.

myFunc() // 666;
`

Now this code basically does the exact same thing but with closure. When the foo function is called the 'a' variable is declared so You might expect the 'a' variable to not be available after the call since it is inside the scope of foo but as I mentioned before scope can be nested and bar still has access to a and the bar function is still available (in the form of myFunc) so as long as the code has access to the bar function it can still remember the 'a' variable. This is the magic of closure.

### Ok, Now What? How can I use Closures?

Well, The simple answer is, you already are using closures. Even if you are relatively new to JavaScript there's a very good chance if you look at your code again you'll find closures. Let me explain, whenever you pass a functions that access their own scope as an argument your're using clousre.

`button.addEventListener("click",function(e){ e.preventDefault()// this works because of closure e can be accessed when it finally runs } ) function alertUser(name){ aler("Welcome " + name + " ,you are logged in."); // this works because of closure name can be accessed when it finally runs } singUp(callback){ // do something callback(); } singUp(alertUser(name);`

### How I finally figured out Scopes and Closures

I have recently been reading the [You don't know JS](https://linkto/YDKJS) series by [Kyle Simpson](https://www.twitter.com/@getify) which I highly reccommend to any JS developer who wants to really understand the ins and outs of the language. If you are a beginner then you might want to start of with some more begginer friendly books as this series of books is more of an in depth guide that might be overwhelming to beginners.

I have been doing frontend javascript for a year (vue and react) and I recently switched to full stack with node.js so I really wanted to get a better understanding of the language, Hence I started reading [YDKJS](https://linkto/YDKJS) and I was not disapointed at all. These books is really like the bible of JavaScript. I have only just finished the second book and I already have learn't so much.

Now, enough of the long boring intro, now to get on with it. The second book of the [YDKJS](https://linkto/YDKJS) series is called Scopes and Closures and I admit that I never really had a good enough understanding of how they really worked in JavaScript unitl I read this book.
