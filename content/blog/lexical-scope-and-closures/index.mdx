### Do I really need to understand these things?

Can't I just memorize some stuff about scopes and closures for job interviews and will I even use closures in my code? Nope, scopes and closures are not just something you memorize for job interviews and Yes, you're 100% gonna use closures. Read till the end of this article and it may surprise you how much of JavaScript code uses closures.

### How Scope works in JavaScript

> Scope consists of a series of bubbles that each act as a container or bucket in which identifiers are declared , these bubbles nest inside each other and this nesting is defined at author time.

![scopes in JavaScript](./scopes.png)

Scope is just the set of rules that govern how the JavaScript engine can look up a variable and figure out it's value. JavaScript had only function scope (with a few exceptions) until ES6 which meant that whenever a new function was declared a new scope was created.

```javascript
//global scope
var i = 666;
console.log(i); // 666

function foo() {
  // scope of foo
  var i = 777;
  console.log(i); // 777
}

foo();
```

_**note:** you might have heard the term lexical scope which is the scope that is defined during a step in the compilation process called lexing. It basically means that scope is defined when you are writing the code (declaring functions), instead of when it is actually executed during runtime._

### Scopes in ES6

ES6 introduced two different ways to declare variables using let and const which can be used for block scoping. In other words, whenever you use let or const to declare variables they are scoped to the block ( any code surrounded by a pair of curly brackets {} ).

```javascript
//global scope
var i = 666;
console.log(i); // 666

{
  // new block scope
  // you'll probably see these types of blocks used with
  // if,else,for,while,etc rather that used like this
  let i = 777;
  console.log(i); // 777
}
```

### Scopes are nested

Another important thing you need to know before we dive into closures is that scopes are nested. The inner scope has access to the outer enclosing scope but the outer scope can't access the variables declared in the inner scope.

```javascript
function foo() {
  let i = 777;
  console.log(i); // 777
  console.log(b); // Refference Error (outer scope can't access variables in inner scope)

  function bar() {
    console.log(i); // 777 (inner scope can access the enclosing outer scope)
    console.log(c); // Refference Error (can't access inner scope)
    let b = 'hello';
    {
      console.log(b); // can access outer scope
      // hello
      let c = 'bye';
    }
  }

  bar();
}
foo();
```

### What are closures

Closure is when a function can remember and access it's scope even when it's called outside it's scope.

```javascript
function foo() {
  let a = 666;
  function bar() {
    console.log(a); // 666
  }
  bar();
}
foo();
```

This is a pretty simple function which just showcases the nesting of scope as we've seen before. When bar is called it has access to the variable 'a' so it can successfully log the value. Now, take a look at the next example which does the same thing but uses closure.

```javascript
function foo() {
  let a = 666;
  function bar() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return bar;
}
let myFunc = foo(); // now myFunc is just a reference to the bar function inside foo.

myFunc(); // 666;
```

Now this code basically does the exact same thing but with closure. When the foo function is called the 'a' variable is declared so You might expect the 'a' variable to not be available after exiting the foo function during execution since, it is inside the scope of foo but as I mentioned before scope can be nested and bar still has access to the a variable and the bar function can still be called (in the form of myFunc) so as long as the code has access to the bar function it can still remember the 'a' variable. This is the magic of closure.

### Ok, Now What? How can I use Closures?

Well, The simple answer is, you are probably already using closures. Even if you are relatively new to JavaScript, there's a very good chance if you look at your code again you'll find some closures. Let me explain, whenever you pass a function (that has access to it's own scope) as an argument your're using closures. In the case of event handlers, Ajax requests, web workers or any other asynchronous (or synchronous) tasks, when you pass in a callback function you're probably using closures.

```javascript
function greet(message) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // this annonymous function will run 3 seconds after calling the greet function
    // but, it still has access to the message variable because of closure
    console.log(message);
  }, 3000);
}

greet('hello john');

// you can use closures to create private variables inside functions that can't be accessed
// outside of the function

let updateClickCount = (function() {
  let counter = 0; // this variable can only be changed by calling the updateClickCount
  return function() {
    ++counter;
    console.log(counter);
  };
})(); // self invoking function runs once and sets counter to 0;

// The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function!
updateClickCount(); // 1;
updateClickCount(); // 2;
```

_**note:** JavaScript modules are also created in a similar way using closures, [read more about the module pattern using closures](https://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/javascript-closures-and-the-module-pattern/)_

### How I finally figured out Scopes and Closures

I have recently been reading the [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) series by [Kyle Simpson](https://www.twitter.com/@getify) which I highly reccommend to any JS developer who wants to really understand the ins and outs of the language. If you are a beginner then you might want to start of with some more begginer friendly books as this series of books is more of an in depth guide that might be overwhelming to beginners.

I have been doing frontend javascript for a year (vue and react) and I recently switched to full stack with node.js so I really wanted to get a better understanding of the language, So I started reading [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) and I was not disapointed . These books are really like the bible of JavaScript.

By the way, this is my first ever published post so I appreciate any constructive criticism about my writing. Thanks for reading.
